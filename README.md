# C++ Keylogger
A simple keylogger written in C++.

# Purpose
This is just a proof of concept project to show the base of what a keylogger really is. If you want to build on this project, some tasks can include decrypting browser passwords as well as taking screenshots which are both pretty easy to implement.

# Disclaimer
This software is not intended for any malicious purposes and is soleley intended for the education of aspiring security professionals who want to study how to prevent software such as this. If you wish to request a full fledged keylogger written in C++ **(FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY)**, you can write to me at rohanpatra2003@gmail.com.
